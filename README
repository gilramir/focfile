FocFile is a free C++ library for you to use with your programs. With it,
you can read FOCUS file directly from your C++ program. FOCUS and PC/FOCUS

comments, suggestions, or flames, send them to me, not IBI.

Fun stuff
______________________________________________________________________

FocFile is a C++ library that reads FOCUS files created on an Intel
platform.  The library gives your programs direct, read-only access to
FOCUS files, allowing you to create highly-optimized data-extraction
programs. 

FocFile has been developed for reading PC/FOCUS 6.01 FOCUS files. If you
have access to both FOCUS and a C++ compiler on another platform, please
feel free to try FocFile on that platform. If you have any suggestions or
code that will extend the functionality of FocFile, please let me know.
I'll incorporate those modifications into FocFile.

Thank you for taking the time to try out this library. This is the second
alpha distribution, so don't expect perfection. Actually, all the
documented functions (next, match, hold) seem to work very well. I have
found no errors since the alpha-1 distribution. FocFile is still alpha,
however, because it doesn't have all the features I'd like it to have for
version 1.0. The one feature I *really* want for version 1.0 is
one-to-many joins.

If you are lucky, indices will work for you. There are different version
of FOCUS indices, even on the same platform, so don't worry when FocFile
dies on your file. Let me know about it, and together we can patch
FocFile so that it can read your index.

The file 'progman.txt' is the programmer's manual. You need to read this.
Postscript, TeX DVI, and HTML versions of this document are also
available on the FocFile home page:

The Makefile supplied with the FocFile should create a library file
'focfile.a'  Please read chapter 2 of the programmer's manual for further
installation instructions.

A sample program 'testcar.cpp' shows you how to read the CAR FOCUS file
that came with your FOCUS distribution.

Enjoy!
