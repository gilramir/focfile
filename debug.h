/*  debug.h
	-------
	Macros for doing debug work.

	Define DEBUG_PROGRAM_NAME to the name of your program. It will print out in
	all debug messages, to separate your program's debug messages from
	other programs' messages.

	Define DEBUG to invoke the debug macros. Undefine (or don't define)
	DEBUG to not have debug messages.

	In either case, you now have three printf()-like functions:

		debug()	for debug-only messages
		warn()	to print to stderr
		die()	to print to stderr and exit with failure
